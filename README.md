Back-end
*************
To run the backend you can just open the BE filder in the terminal and run the following command
npm start

* this application will work without connecting to db as well, i have used the JSON file as the alternative for the easy implimantation
* if you are intrested to use the Db you can change the configurations in the .env file to your MYsql congifuration
the server will throw as error, if you are not connected to dp then a message stating that server is running at the post X, as at that time the application will use the JSON file as alternative. the error is intentionally printed.
